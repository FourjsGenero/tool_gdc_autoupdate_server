# tool_gdc_autoupdate_server
As you know Genero 3.10 come with a new feature : GDC autoupdate.
It is based on a GDC shortcut that executes through GAS a Genero BDL application. This Genero application executes some test of GDC version installed and execute the frontcall that will autoupdate your GDC.

Here is a demo that Four Js provided during the Genero EAP 3.10 before the GA.

We posted today the first version, and we are preparing the installation guide for its installation and deploymeent. It will be ready in few days.
